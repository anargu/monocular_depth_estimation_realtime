# Monocular Depth Estimation Realtime

this project aims to achieve depth estimation in realtime that can be implemented in mobile devices.

## Current state

Work in progress. It has a CNN Model which extends from mobilenet and some changes were made on the decoder part. This model is not identical but extracts some traits from this [paper](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~walon/publications/chiu2020icpr.pdf).
